# Wireless-and-Mobile-Networking
The MATLAB homework of Wireless and Mobile Networking by Prof. Hung-Yu Wei, Fall 2024

## Homework 1
- Implement two-ray-ground model radio propagation, with only path loss downlink traffic.
- Simulate path loss and log-normal shadowing in radio propagation, and compute SINR.

## Homework 2
- Simulate downlink or uplink traffic of 50 devices (in random area) in 19 base stations, then calculate received power and SINR.

## Homework 3
- Simulate downlink traffic of a **moving** device (uniform speed and angle distribution) in 19 base stations
  - Assign IDs to base stations
  - Design handover rules (alleviating ping-pong effect)

## Homework 4
- Simulate different traffic loads of a base station. Assume each device has constant bit rate traffic.
